# matlab_OEO_phasenoise_simulation
It's the simulation code of my graduation project in CQU and IECAS, which is called “Study on the Ultra-low Phase noise OEO”
# DIL_OEO matlab simulation code
DIL_OEO2.m invokes the function of longloop and shortloop
longloop and shortloop are the single loop OEO model
DIL_OEO2.m do the job of injecting the longloop's oscillate signal to the shortloop and get the output of shortloop
